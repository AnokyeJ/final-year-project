Technology Review
Key Themes or Topics
Organize the body of your review into themes or categories. Here are suggestions for your project and course:

a. Web Design Principles and User Experience (UX)
Discuss principles like responsive design, accessibility, and intuitive navigation.
Cite key works (e.g., Nielsen's heuristics or studies on user behavior).
Relate these principles to your project: How will they enhance the usability of the News Aggregator?
b. Technologies for Web Development
Frontend Development: Explore HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Vue.js. Discuss their role in creating interactive and user-friendly designs.
Backend Development: Compare Django (Python) and Node.js (JavaScript), their use cases, and why Django is suitable for your project.
APIs and Integration: Highlight the importance of APIs (e.g., News API) in aggregating external data for dynamic content.
c. Information Architecture
Discuss strategies for organizing content effectively, particularly for websites dealing with large datasets, such as news articles.
Refer to research or case studies on how content filtering, categorization, and search functionality improve user experience.
d. Tools and Testing Methods
Review tools like Figma for UI/UX design, Django for backend development, and Postman for API testing.
Discuss testing methodologies (e.g., usability testing, cross-browser testing) relevant to web projects.
e. Ethics in Web Development
Discuss the importance of ethical considerations, such as data privacy and user consent, particularly for projects handling external APIs.
f. Challenges in Aggregating and Filtering Data
Review literature on handling large-scale data aggregation, API rate limits, and strategies to overcome these challenges (e.g., caching, pagination).
